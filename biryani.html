        <li>2 tbsp hot milk + 2 tbsp hot water</li>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>Marinate the Chicken: In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, garam masala, salt, turmeric, red chili powder, lemon juice (if using), and chicken pieces. Mix well and coat the chicken evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight for deeper flavors.

        Fry the Onions: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and fry until golden brown and crispy. Drain the onions on paper towels to remove excess oil.
        
        Cook the Rice: Rinse the soaked basmati rice until the water runs clear. In a large pot, heat oil, cloves, cinnamon stick, and green cardamoms. Add the rinsed rice and salt. Stir to combine. Pour in enough water to cover the rice by about an inch (2.5 cm). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover the pot, and simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the rice is ¾ cooked. Drain the rice, discarding the spices.
        
        Assemble the Biryani: In a large pot or baking dish, spread half of the cooked rice. Top with half of the marinated chicken pieces. Sprinkle with half of the fried onions, coriander leaves, mint leaves, and biryani masala. Repeat the layering with the remaining rice, chicken, fried onions, herbs, and masala.
        
        Saffron (or Food Coloring): Soak the saffron strands in the hot milk and water mixture for a few minutes. If using food coloring, add it to the saffron mixture. Pour this saffron water evenly over the layered biryani.
        
        Dum Cooking: Drizzle melted ghee over the biryani. Cover the pot or dish tightly with aluminum foil and a lid to seal it completely. This creates a "dum" effect, allowing the biryani to steam and cook through gently.
        
        Cook on Low Heat:  Place the pot/dish on the stovetop over low heat and cook for 20-25 minutes. Alternatively, you can preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and bake the biryani for 20-25 minutes.
        
        Rest and Serve: Once cooked, turn off the heat and let the biryani rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to further develop and the rice to absorb the remaining moisture. Fluff the biryani gently with a fork and serve hot. Enjoy!

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <p>You can use boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts for this recipe, if preferred. Adjust the cooking time accordingly for boneless pieces.
        For a richer flavor, use bone-in chicken pieces. However, you will need to adjust the cooking time to ensure the chicken is cooked through.
        If you don't have biryani masala, you can use a blend of garam masala, coriander powder, cumin powder, and cardamom powder.
        You can adjust the amount of red chili powder according to your spice preference.
        For a vegetarian option, replace the chicken with vegetables like potatoes, peas, or cauliflower.</p>
