    <h1>Custard Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>4-5 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons custard powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons whole milk (warm or at room temperature)</li>
        <li>1.5 to 2 cups chopped mixed fruits (apples, mangoes, bananas, pears, strawberries, pomegranate are all good options)</li>
        <li>Chopped nuts, dry fruits, whipped cream, or a maraschino cherry for garnish (Optional)</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <p>Heat the milk: In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat 2.5 cups of milk over medium heat. Add sugar and stir constantly until the sugar dissolves completely.

        Prepare the custard base: While the milk heats up, take 3 tablespoons of custard powder in a small bowl. Add 3 tablespoons of warm or room temperature milk and whisk it vigorously until you get a smooth, lump-free mixture. Tip: Using cold milk can cause the custard to curdle.
        
        Temper the custard: Once the milk is hot (but not boiling), reduce the heat to low. Slowly whisk in the custard mixture, a little at a time, into the hot milk. Make sure to whisk constantly to incorporate the custard and prevent lumps from forming.
        
        Thicken the custard: Continue whisking the custard mixture for 5-7 minutes, or until it thickens to a nappe consistency. Nappe consistency means that when you coat the back of a spoon with the custard and run your finger through it, a clear line forms that holds its shape for a moment.
        
        Cool the custard: Remove the pan from the heat and transfer the custard to a bowl. Let it cool completely at room temperature. Cover the surface of the custard with plastic wrap directly touching the custard to prevent a skin from forming.
        
        Prepare the fruits: While the custard cools, wash and chop your chosen fruits into bite-sized pieces.
        
        Assemble the dessert: Once the custard is cool, gently fold in the chopped fruits. You can add chopped nuts or dry fruits for additional texture at this stage.
        
        Chill and serve: Pour the fruit custard into individual serving dishes or a larger serving bowl. Cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or until chilled and set.
        
        Garnish and enjoy! Before serving, garnish your fruit custard with whipped cream, a maraschino cherry, or some extra chopped nuts or fruits for a delightful presentation.</p>
    <h2>Tips:</h2>    
    <p>For a richer custard, you can use heavy cream instead of whole milk.
        If you don't have custard powder, you can make a cornstarch slurry as a substitute. Mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 3 tablespoons of milk to form a smooth paste. Add this mixture to the hot milk along with the custard mixture and follow the remaining steps.
        If you prefer a looser custard consistency, simply add a little more milk after it has cooled.</p>
