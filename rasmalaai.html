    <h1>Rasmalaai Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>For the Rasmalai Balls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 liter full-cream milk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup lemon juice (or enough to curdle the milk)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>For the Flavored Milk:</p>
<ul>
    <li>3-3.5 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>⅓ cup sugar</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>5-6 cardamom pods, crushed</li>
    <li>1 tbsp slivered pistachios</li>
    <li>A pinch of saffron strands (soaked in 1 tablespoon warm milk)</li>
</ul>
    <p>Garnish:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chopped pistachios and almonds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <p>In a large pot, heat the milk to a boil.
        Once boiling, remove from heat and gradually add lemon juice, stirring constantly, until the milk curdles completely. (Tip: The amount of lemon juice may vary depending on milk quality. Add it a little at a time to avoid over-curdling.)
        If using, add the all-purpose flour to the curdled milk and mix well.
        Strain the curdled milk through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer placed over a bowl.
        Rinse the curds with cool water to remove any excess lemon juice.
        Gather the cheesecloth and squeeze out as much whey (liquid) as possible.
        Hang the cheesecloth for 30 minutes to further drain any remaining whey.
        Knead the dough gently for a few minutes until smooth. Be careful not to overwork it, as this can make the balls tough.
        Pinch off small pieces of dough and roll them into smooth balls. Make sure there are no cracks on the surface.
        Make the Flavored Milk:
        
        In a separate pan, combine the milk, sugar, and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar.
        Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes, allowing the milk to thicken slightly.
        Add the crushed cardamom pods and simmer for another 5 minutes.
        Strain the milk to remove the cardamom pods.
        Gently stir in the saffron-infused milk.
        Assemble the Rasmalai:
        
        Gently drop the rasmalai balls into the simmering flavored milk.
        Cover the pan and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the balls double in size and become soft and spongy.
        Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.
        Serving:
        
        Refrigerate the rasmalai for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to develop.
        When ready to serve, garnish with chopped pistachios and almonds.</p>
        <h2>Tips:</h2>
        <p>For richer flavored milk, you can substitute some of the whole milk with evaporated milk or heavy cream.
            If you don't have saffron, you can omit it or use a few drops of yellow food coloring.
            To make sure the rasmalai balls are soft, don't overcook them in the flavored milk.
            Leftover rasmalai can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>
