        <h2>Process:</h2>
    <p> 
        In a pressure cooker, combine the beef, bones (if using), onion, ginger, garlic, whole spices (coriander seeds, fennel seeds, cumin seeds, cinnamon stick, black cardamom pods, star anise, mace, bay leaves, and cloves), and water.
        Bring to a boil, then pressure cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the beef is tender.
        Release the pressure naturally, then remove the beef and set it aside. Strain the stock and discard the solids.
        Reduce the stock over medium heat until it reaches about 3 cups.Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and fry until golden brown.
        Add the ginger, garlic, and green chilies. Cook for a minute, until fragrant.
        Stir in the red chili flakes (if using), ground coriander, ground cumin, whole red chilies, bay leaf, star anise, and green cardamoms.
        Saute for 30 seconds, until the spices release their aroma.
        Add the yogurt and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the yogurt releases its water and oil separates from the masala.Add the cooked beef, chopped tomatoes, and reserved beef stock to the pot. Season with salt to taste.
        Bring to a boil, then stir in the soaked basmati rice.
        Gently level the rice and cover the pot tightly with a lid.
        Reduce heat to low and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.
        Turn off the heat and let the pulao stand for 5-10 minutes before fluffing with a fork.Garnish the pulao with chopped fresh coriander leaves and fried onions (if using).
        Serve hot with raita or your favorite chutney.

    <h2>Tips:</h2>    
    <p>You can adjust the amount of spices according to your preference.
        For a richer flavor, you can use ghee instead of vegetable oil.
        If you don't have beef bones, you can use store-bought beef broth instead of making the yakhni.
        Leftover beef pulao can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</p>
